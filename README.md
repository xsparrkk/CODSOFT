# CODSOFT INTERNSHIP
🐍 Python Projects under my Codsoft Internship

This repository contains three  Python projects that I developed during my 1-month internship at Codsoft.
These projects helped me practice Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and logic building while working on real-world mini applications.

📌 Projects
1️⃣ Rock Paper Scissors 🎮

A simple GUI-based game where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

User selects Rock/Paper/Scissors

Computer randomly chooses its move

Python 3.x
(No external libraries required — everything is built using Python’s standard library.)

🏅 Internship Note

These projects were created as part of my Codsoft Internship Program (1-month), where I gained practical experience in:

Writing clean and efficient Python code

Solving real-world programming problems

Building small applications with user interaction
